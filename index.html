        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ivana Wu and I am a first year student at UCR with a major in pre-business.
<br><br>

        I am a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), majoring in pre-business with an expected graduation year of 2027. I am a recent graduate of San Gabriel High School, where I held leadership roles in several student organizations, including serving as committee leader in ASB, secretary in the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), and vice president of a volunteer club named Karebear.
 
<br><br>

        My leadership capabilities shine through my involvement in various student organizations, notably as the Secretary and Elections Committee Leader in ASB at San Gabriel High School. In this capacity, I successfully organized fundraising activities, managed school-wide votes, and encouraged active student participation, thereby fostering a strong sense of community and school pride.

<br><br>
   
        In my professional endeavors, I have gained valuable skills and expertise. As a Cashier and Waitress at Good China, I efficiently managed cash transactions, resolved customer complaints, and maintained high standards of customer service. In my role as a Summer Camp Tutor at Tu Qian You Summer School, I designed and executed comprehensive lesson plans, providing individualized instruction to help students achieve their academic goals. I had a lot of dedication to fostering independent learning and enhancing communication skills among students.

<br><br>
  
        Additionally, I am multilingual, fluent in English, Cantonese, and Mandarin, enabling effective communication across diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. My proficiency in languages reflects my adaptability and ability to connect with a wide range of people. My achievements in Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) competitions underscore my aptitude in business-related disciplines. I have won competitions in categories such as Parliamentary Procedure, Business Management, and Business Communication, which showcase my expertise and competitive spirit.

<br><br>

        I am assured that my meticulous attention to detail, effective time management, and strong organizational skills will enable me to excel in any given position. I possess advanced technological proficiency and maintain a continuous commitment to self-improvement.  My diverse skill set, encompassing leadership, effective communication, multilingual proficiency, and academic excellence, positions me as a valuable asset in any professional or educational setting. My proactive approach to learning allowds for my ability to excel in various roles.
